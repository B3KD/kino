**`HIDE POINTS`** hides the points counter.

**`HIDE NAMES`** hides the nicknames of other players (a bit buggy).

**`FORCE WHITE SMOKE TO ALL`** makes the smoke of all players white if you're getting annoyed by the colored smoke.

**`BUMPER CLIPPING`** makes the collision of your car smaller allowing your bumpers to slighly clip though the object so you wouldn't crash just from a small wall scratch.

**`DISABLE CONSOLE COLLISIONS`** will disable collisions with console players.

**`HIDE CONSOLE PLAYERS`** will hide them completely.

**`FLY SPEED`** and **`FLY SPEED MULTIPLIER`** are the sliders used to control the speed of the noclip/flymod feature. You can only use it in modded (corrupted lobbies). This feature exists only for modded maps.

**`LOADED MODULES`** is a list of mod modules that are curently being used by the mod. You can disable certain modules if you believe that they affect your game's performance or have conflicts with other mods.
