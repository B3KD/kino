## About
 The mod that has become pupular for it's lighting and livery sharing features.  
 Still in active development with more things getting added.
 
 Brief explanation of features is listed bellow. You can click on the titles for more detailed explanation along with the screenshots of the mentioned tabs. 
## Features

* [**Car Lights**](https://github.com/trbflxr/kino/blob/master/Help/CarLights.md)  
Lights for your car with pre-configured locations for both your headlights, tail lights and hazard lights. Light positions and color settings are synced between players who have the mod.
* [**World Lighting**](https://github.com/trbflxr/kino/blob/master/Help/WorldLighting.md)  
Allows to change the sunlight, skybox and ambient light brightness. Most people use this for night mode but you can actually make pretty nice looking morning/daylight configs. Also you can enable the volumetric fog and change it's distance and volume.
* [**Visuals**](https://github.com/trbflxr/kino/blob/master/Help/Visuals.md)  
Allows to save your liveries for copying (in case you want to experiment on it without risking unwanted changes being saved), creating backups (you never know when your profile can get reset for no reason), or sharing them with other players or apply the downloaded liveries.
Also gives the ability to offset the camera in livery editor for easier livery creation.
* [**Settings**](https://github.com/trbflxr/kino/blob/master/Help/Settings.md)   
You can change the mod language from here. Currently avaliable languages are: ENG, FR, RU, JP, NL, PL, ITA. If you wish to help us translate the mod to your native language feel free to contact us on discord (link at the top)  
Also has the options to hide points counter and nicknames. Enable the custom tachometer (works after hiding the UI with F11). Force the white smoke to all the players (if you get annoyed by colored smoke). Disable collision with console players, or hide them completely! There's also an option for custom backfire.
* [**Extras**](https://github.com/trbflxr/kino/blob/master/Help/Extras.md)  
An extra module that is given as a "thanks you" to players who supported the mod development by donating. Has a few neat features such as the ability to disable collisions with chosen players, adding a custom tag for your nickname (so you don't have to clutter your steam name), changing the tire pressure on the go and the experimental features that hasn't been made public yet such as **engine swaps** for now.
