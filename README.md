### Required: [BepInEx mod loader](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
## About
This mod consists of multiple modules such as cinematic that is mainly based around the ability to record replays and playing them back at any moment, custom lights, and livery sharing. The mod also has multiple small side features to enhance your experience.

### Modules
* Cinematic  
Main focus of this module is it's replay feature to record and playback your multiplayer runs with up to 16 cars. It also allows you to create and animate custom cameras via keyframes.
* Lights  
Lights for your car with pre-configured locations for both your headlights and tail lights. You can also add lights to other players' cars and tweak the lights to your liking.
This module also has sliders to configure world lighting to create gloomy weather or a dark night.
* Visuals
Allows for saving your liveries for copying (in case you want to experiment on it without risking unwanted changes being saved), creating backups (you never know when your profile can get reset for no reason), or sharing them with other players.  
Also gives the ability to offset the camera in livery editor for easier livery creation.

### How to use
